# Serial-Killers-Info

Info on all the top serial killers in the world. I will keep updating it.

Run the python script "serialkillers.py" and input the name of the serial killer you want to know about, from the given list. If the name is valid, you'll be given some basic info about the serial killer you are interested in knowing about. If you want to add some data in the sqllite db you can use the add file to do so, where you can enter your entries for the killer by input prompts in your command line.

I will be adding the update and delete part for the db later.
